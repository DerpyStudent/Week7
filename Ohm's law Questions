1. Total Resistance = 20,000 Ohms. Total Current = 0.00025A

2. Total Resistance = 15,000 Ohms. Total Current = 0.00033A 

3. V=IR
5V/15000 Ohms = 0.00033A
V=IR = (0.00033)(10,000)=3.3V = Voltage lost through R_A

V=IR = (0.00033)(5,000)=1.65V = Voltage lost through R_B

3.3V+1.65V=4.95, which is close enough to 5V
